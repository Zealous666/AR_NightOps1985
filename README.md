Mission 1 - Flashpoint 1985
===

Before invading Everon Main island, take control of a little island in the north.
Assault and capture the Soviet Com Truck to accomplish the mission. Before that, you might have to fulfil some tasks by securing critial positions as well as a bonus objective to gain an APC with moving spawnpoint.

Mission 2 - Night Operations
===

Use the radio in the BlackOps hideout to start one of three operations on Everon.
Either aquire several intel pieces, infiltrate a base to destroy its fuel trucks or chase and neutralize a high valuable target. You can establish temporary bivouacs to create addition spawnpoints on the go.


Mission 3 - Combat Patrol
===

Attack and secure Morton before starting to a mechanized combat patrol.
Once Morton is taken, use the mission map and decide which combat patrol to start. Then escort your command truck with the respawning light combat vehicles as a mobile spawnpoint through several vulnerable points to the target destination.


Mission 4 - Cold War Crisis
===

Capture the airbase and establish a defense perimeter to strike back the counter-attack.
Once the airbase is ours, use the provided ressources to build some defense structures and unleash your infantry to neutralize all enemy waves. You can either be a commander or the special operator at the ground.


Mission 5 - Armed Assault
===

Enter the combat vehicles at the airbase and start a large-scaled assault to push the enemy off the island
You can capture strategic points and establish support positions to push the enemy more and more south and finally off the island to conquer Everon once and for all.
